# DreamNDine Project

## Overview

DreamNDine reimagines property management and dining experiences with a user-centric, .NET 8.0-powered web application. This project actively explores .NET technologies for my thesis. It adopts a layered architecture, including a client-facing web application (DreamNDine.Client), a backend API (DreamNDine.API), and a business logic layer (DreamNDine.BLL).

## Development Status

**Please note:** DreamNDine is a work in progress, demonstrating my ongoing learning with .NET technologies in a real-world project context for my thesis. Features and improvements are added regularly. 

## Project Structure

* **DreamNDine.API**: RESTful backend managing property, user, and dining data.
* **DreamNDine.BLL**: Core business logic layer, ensuring data integrity.
* **DreamNDine.Client**: ASP.NET Core user-friendly interface. 
* **DbContext**: `DreamNDineContext` for Entity Framework Core object-database mapping.

## Key Features

* **Property Management**: Create, update, and delete property listings.
* **User Authentication**: Secure user registration, authentication, and profiles.
* **Dining Reservations**: Book dining experiences at properties.
* **Reviews and Ratings**: Share feedback and insights.

## Technologies Used

* .NET 8.0
* Entity Framework Core
* ASP.NET Core
